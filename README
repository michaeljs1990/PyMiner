#PyMiner version 0.1.2

All code is currently being tested on an ubuntu OS. 

This module is used to pull down data from various web sites. It's currently in it's first release and only able to pull down images from sites with some flukes. In the future we look to add features such as creating statistics from web page data and are still brainstorming for ideas any thing that would be useful to you let us know.

Thanks for looking at this project that is still in a very early stage.
