#PyMiner version 0.1

This project was developed in order to create an easy to use command line tool that
will let you manipulate websites in a few ways. We hope to make it easy to pull down
images, links, and statistics. As the project develops I will lay out everything it 
will perform in a more structured way.

Thanks for your interest,
